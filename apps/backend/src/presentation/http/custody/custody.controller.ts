/**
 * CUSTODY CONTROLLER
 *
 * Presentation Layer - HTTP Adapter
 *
 * Manages custody operations (on-chain deposits/withdrawals).
 * Deposits move funds from wallet to custody contract, creating unified balance.
 *
 * Flow: Wallet (on-chain) → Custody Contract → Unified Balance
 *
 * This is the FIRST step in Yellow Network flow:
 *   1. Deposit to custody (this controller) - ON-CHAIN
 *   2. Fund channel (optional) - moves to 2-party channel
 *   3. Create app session - multi-party off-chain
 *
 * Endpoints:
 * POST /custody/deposit - Deposit funds to custody contract
 *
 * NOTE: This is a PLACEHOLDER controller since custody operations
 * require direct smart contract interaction which needs proper
 * Web3 setup. For now, this returns a helpful message.
